# IPL2021-Twitter-Trends
This project aims to study and analyze different social media buzz (Twitter), which the IPLâ€™s marketing team can convert into actionable insights to devise a suitable marketing and advertising campaign for the brand-new IPL merchandise scheduled to launch during the current season. A large enough dataset of sample tweets was extracted using R Programming techniques and then cleaned to exclude the redundant data and process the remaining data into a usable format. Further, 5 different KPIs were created and the trends were visualized by creating a dashboard using Tableau.
